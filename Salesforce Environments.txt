Salesforce is known as the world's number one CRM and has been recongnized by global leaders all over the world. Salesforce as a platform provides main support for SAAS and PAAS services. SAAS means software as a service and it provides this service on rent which is similar to rented property and within salesforce we purchanse lincense based on users as well as the salesforce editions which we purchase. PAAS means platform as a service and you take Force.com/Heroku to customize your application but we need salesforce environments so that developers can perform there metadata changes and write code with respect to there business requirement.

Summary Of Environments

Environment In Salesforce: 

Environments in salesforce is an instance of the force.com salesforce platform.It is also known as orgs or organization in salesforce. If someone is talking about orgs it means that he is talking about Environments in salesforce.
There are many functionalities as well as features of salesforce environments which are mentioned below;
1. Salesforce Environments can be utilized for developing code, testing the functionality of the code, training users and used as a production environment for end users.
2. Every salesforce evnironment has its own data storage and you can perform configuration, integration as well as customization based on the features that you want to develop for your client.
3. The functionaltiy that I have discussed so far in points 1, 2 is based on the salesforce editions that you purchase, if you would like to purchase any salesforce edition you can look into there website mentioned here "https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud/".
4. As we all know salesforce is on cloud hence, the way you login to your system is via an internet service provider like Google, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer etc. The other ways to loging is via SOAP API or Metadata API.

Introduction To Sandbox

Sandbox is a copy of production organisation or a copy of any other salesforce environment that you are presently using that can be used to perform tasks like configuration, customization and development of lightning components.These sandboxes can used by developers to develop there code / feature. If you want to do a test for these features you can create a new testing sandbox also known as quality assurance sandbox. If you want to give Training to an individual you can also create a sandbox from production/other sandboxes.

What is Refresh Of Sandbox?

Refresh of sandbox: It is a term which is also used to create a sandbox from production/clone a sandbox from another sandbox. When I say "refresh a sandbox named as "DevSFDC247" it means to create a sandbox name it as DevSFDC247 from production/clone it from another sandbox. Give this sandbox a description to define the purpose of the sandbox that you are creating.

What is Refresh Interval In Sandbox?

The refresh interval is the number of days at which the salesforce server will be availaible to synchronize its records with the production environment of salesforce. There are different refresh intervals for different different sandboxes, which I will discuss in the Types of sandbox section.
